# HTML & CSS CONCEPTS & QUESTIONS
### <span style="color: aqua">What does it mean for a website to be responsive?</span>
Ultimately, a responsive website is one in which the pages and content can adapt to deliver the best experience to the users regardless of what device they're using. Responsive web design allows for websites to adapt and render on all manner of devices and screen sizes.

### <span style="color: aqua">What is CSS specificity?</span>
Every selector is ranked in a specificity hierarchy. These include:  
- Inline Styles
- IDs
- Classes, Attributes, & Pseudo-Classes
- Elements & Pseudo-Elements  

Specificity is scored whereby the highest ranking style declaration is what wins out in being applied to an element when two or more CSS/style rules are in conflict.


### <span style="color: aqua">Where would you link a JS file in your HTML?</span>
Scripts can be placed in either the head or the body of an HTML page. A good rule of thumb is to place it toward the bottom of the page, just before the closing ```</body>``` tag. The idea behind this is that scripts can block parallel downloads and so by placing the external file lower in the body JS parsing and execution doesn't stop the browser from loading the rest of the page.  

### <span style="color: aqua">What are the benefits of maintaining an external Javascript file?</span>
* External scripts separate JS code from HTML.  
* Makes code easier to read and maintain.  
* Cached JS files can speed up page loads.
