# JAVASCRIPT CONCEPTS & QUESTIONS

### :scroll: <span style="color: aqua">What is AJAX?</span>
AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. It isn't a programming language but rather a method through which we are able to make HTTP requests. AJAX uses a combination of:  
* A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)  
* JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)  

AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes. Meaning that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.

### :scroll: <span style="color: aqua">Tell me about when you may need to use AJAX?</span>
When I want some change to occur within a page in real time without reloading the entire page itself. Chat Bot interaction or Captcha validation / reloading are excellent examples where users would need to interact with something on a page and not have the page reload entirely.

### :scroll: <span style="color: aqua">What does callback mean in JS?</span>
JS functions are executed in the sequence they're called, not in the sequence they're defined. A ***callback*** is a function passed as an argumnt to another function. For instance, a callback function may take an input and display some data on a page. Passing it to a function that performs some calculation and then passing the result to the callback function will then display that calculation. This is a fairly simplified example, callbacks are best seen in asynchronous functions where 1 function has to wait for another function (i.e. waiting for a file to load).
