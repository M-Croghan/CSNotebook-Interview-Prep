### <span style="color: aqua">Disucss the difference between _compiled_ & _interpreted_ languages:</span>
* Compiled Languages (C, C++, Go) - Converts source code to machine code instructions.
* Interpreted Languages (JS, Ruby, Python) - Code executes within an interpreter shell.
* Byte-Code Languages (C#, Scala, Java) - Compiled into bytecode and executed in the JVM. Involves JIT compiler (_just in time_) which inspects code as it executes.

### <span style="color: aqua">List the 4 main pillars of OOP</span>
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance

### <span style="color: aqua">What is polymorphism?</span>
The ability for an object to also be present in many forms. Sub classes could inherit attributes and methods from a superclass (i.e. Animal). Polymorphism uses the methods to perform different tasks. For instance, a cat class and a dog class both inherit the animal sound from the Animal superclass. However, the cat 'meows' whereas the dog 'barks'.

### <span style="color: aqua">What is abstraction?</span>
Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user. Abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it.

### <span style="color: aqua">What is inheritance?</span>
Important in the context of DRY (don’t repeat yourself). Inheritance is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behavior of another object of another class. Gained by implementing interfaces or extending classes. A class cannot inherit more than one class. A class cannot call private methods except indirectly and a superclass can not inherit from a subclass.

### <span style="color: aqua">What is encapsulation?</span>
The bundling of data and the methods that interact with or operate on that data into a single unit in the form of a class. Think of it as like a black box, it doesn’t matter how the internals work, just how you can interact with it. Private fields or methods are an example of protecting the inner workings of a class. 

### <span style="color: aqua">What is Garbage Collection?</span>
Removing unwanted objects to free up memory if they are no longer referenced. Garbage collection is done automatically in Java whenever there is no longer a reference pointed at a specific object. You need not to remove the unwanted objects explicitly. Garbage collector thread does this for you. C/C++ require you to deallocate memory yourself.

### <span style="color: aqua">Explain the Software Developmnt Lifecycle (SDLC)</span>
***Requirements Gathering > Planning > Design > Development > Testing > Deployment > Maintenance***  
* Requirements gathering / pre-planning phase: goal to create a comprehensive list of software requirements specification that reflect all the functional & nonfunction requirements for the end product.
* Architecture Design: involves creating a design document that specifies the architecture based on the data collected. You’re still getting stakeholder input while defining roles and responsibilities.
* Implementation: Main core of the software development process. Involves the actual process of working through the compiled list of necessary work and developing a functional system. It’s the main entry point to production, writing code, testing, and optimizing.
* Testing: generally, a continuous process. Unit testing is an ongoing process throughout development and integration testing is verifying all software components at the final stage of the production.
* Deployment & Delivery
* Maintenance
