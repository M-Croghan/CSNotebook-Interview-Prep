# SPRING FRAMEWORK CONCEPTS & QUESTIONS

### :leaves: <span style="color: aqua">What is a framework?</span>
Frameworks make building applications faster and more efficient. It provides the basis on which developers can build programs for a specific platform. For example, a framework may include predetermined classes as well as functions. It can be used to process inputs, manage hardware, and interact with system software. (ex. Spring is one of the more popular frameworks for Java.)

### :leaves: <span style="color: aqua">What is the default web server built-in to Spring?</span>
Apache Tomcat

### :leaves: <span style="color: aqua">What is Maven?</span>
Maven is a build tool / project management & comprehension tool.
- Makes the build process easier
- Provides a uniform build system
- Provides high quality project info
- Provides guidelines for best practices development
- Allows transparent migration to new features

### :leaves: <span style="color: aqua">What purpose does the pom.xml file serve?</span>
- POM: Project Object Model
  - The fundamental unit of work in Maven
  - Contains info about the project and configuration details used by maven to build the project
    - The dependencies.
### :leaves: <span style="color: aqua">What is Inversion of Control (IoC)?</span>
Instead of the programmer controlling the flow of the program, external sources (framework, services, etc.) take over. The framework makes most of the decisions until it comes time for the application specific logic written by the developer to be called upon, after which the developers code returns control back to the framework.

### :leaves: <span style="color: aqua">What is Dependency Injection?</span>
A dependency is a requirement necessary for something to function. Dependency injection generally means passing a dependent object as a parameter to a method, rather than having the method create the dependent object. This means that a method doesn't need to be dependent on any particular implementation, but one that meets the requirements can be passed to it as parameter. A subset of IoC, an already instantiated instance can be injected into a class, so it can use its methods.  

An example would be that of programming a house-building robot. As it builds the walls of a house, every time it gets to a doorway, it has to make a decision on what door should be installed. It depends on having the exact type and specifications of the door and needs to figure those things out at each doorway. Dependency injection would be purchasing the doors we want from a supplier and passing them to the robot to install.

The process of injecting dependent bean objects into target bean objects is called dependency injection.  

- Setter Injection: The IOC container will inject the dependent bean object into the target bean object by calling the setter method.
- Constructor Injection: The IOC container will inject the dependent bean object into the target bean object by calling the target bean constructor.
- Field Injection: The IOC container will inject the dependent bean object into the target bean object by Reflection API

### :leaves: <span style="color: aqua">What is Aspect-Oriented Programming</span>

### :leaves: <span style="color: aqua">Discuss POJOs & Beans</span>
- POJO: Plain Old Java Object.
  - Any java object is a POJO.
- A Bean is also a POJO
  - But, with a bean, only ***one*** exists of a particular instance.
    - Singleton Pattern
      - Singleton Beans = Stateless Beans

### :leaves: <span style="color: aqua">What is a profile?</span>
Profiles serve as the configuration that govern a given environment (i.e. development, production, etc.). Within a Spring application,
the resources' folder holds the profiles. These profiles are .properties files and follow a naming convention to denote which environment 
they pertain to (i.e. ***application-dev.properties***).
Spring Boot provides various properties which can be specified inside our project's application.properties file. These properties have default values and you can set that inside the properties file. Properties are used to set values like: server-port number, database connection configuration etc.
### :leaves: <span style="color: aqua">What is Spring Boot?</span>
Spring Boot is a Spring module which provides RAD (Rapid Application Development) feature to Spring framework. It is used to create stand alone spring based application that you can just run because it needs very little spring configuration.
### :leaves: <span style="color: aqua">How to create Spring Boot application using Maven?</span>
There are multiple approaches to create Spring Boot project. We can use any of the following approach to create application.
- Spring Maven Project
- Spring Starter Project Wizard
- Spring Initializr
- Spring Boot CLI

### :leaves: <span style="color: aqua">What are the Spring Boot Starters?</span>
Starters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors which we can include in our application.
Spring Boot provides built-in starters which makes development easier and rapid. For example, if we want to get started using Spring and JPA for database access, just include the spring-boot-starter-data-jpa dependency in your project.
### :leaves: <span style="color: aqua">What is Spring Boot Actuator?</span>
Spring Boot provides actuator to monitor and manage our application. Actuator is a tool which has HTTP endpoints. when application is pushed to production, you can choose to manage and monitor your application using HTTP endpoints. Spring Actuator is a cool feature of Spring Boot with the help of which you can see what is happening inside a running application. So, whenever you want to debug your application, and need to analyze the logs you need to understand what is happening in the application right? In such a scenario, the Spring Actuator provides easy access to features such as identifying beans, CPU usage, etc. The Spring Actuator provides a very easy way to access the production-ready REST points and fetch all kinds of information from the web. These points are secured using Spring Securityâ€™s content negotiation strategy.
### :leaves: <span style="color: aqua">How to connect Spring Boot to the database using JPA?</span>
Spring Boot provides spring-boot-starter-data-jpa starter to connect Spring application with relational database efficiently. You can use it into project POM (Project Object Model) file.
### :leaves: <span style="color: aqua">What is @RequestMapping annotation in Spring Boot?</span>
The @RequestMapping annotation is used to provide routing information. It tells to the Spring that any HTTP request should map to the corresponding method. We need to import org.springframework.web.annotation package in our file.
### :leaves: <span style="color: aqua">Spring Vs Spring Boot?</span>
Spring is a web application framework based on Java. It provides tools and libraries to create a complete cutomized web application. Wheras Spring Boot is a spring module which is used to create spring application project that can just run.
### :leaves: <span style="color: aqua">What is the need for Spring Boot DevTools?</span>
Spring Boot Dev Tools are an elaborated set of tools and aims to make the process of developing an application easier. If the application runs in the production, then this module is automatically disabled, repackaging of archives are also excluded by default. So, the Spring Boot Developer Tools applies properties to the respective development environments.

### :leaves: <span style="color: aqua">Mention the differences between JPA and Hibernate.</span>
- JPA is a Data Access Abstraction used to reduce the amount of boilerplate code.
-	Hibernate is an implementation of Java Persistence API and offers benefits of loose coupling.
### :leaves: <span style="color: aqua">Explain Spring Data:</span>
Spring Data aims to make it easy for the developers to use relational and non-relational databases, cloud-based data services, and other data access technologies. So, basically, it makes it easy for data access and still retains the underlying data.
### :leaves: <span style="color: aqua">Features of Spring Boot that make it different?</span>
- Creates stand-alone spring application with minimal configuration needed.
- It has embedded tomcat, jetty which makes it just code and run the application.
- Provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration.
- Absolutely no requirement for XML configuration.

### :leaves: <span style="color: aqua">What are the Spring Boot key components?</span>
Below are the four key components of spring-boot:
- Spring Boot auto-configuration.
- Spring Boot CLI.
- Spring Boot starter POMs.
- Spring Boot Actuators
### :leaves: <span style="color: aqua">How does a spring boot application get started?</span>
Just like any other Java program, a Spring Boot application must have a main method. This method serves as an entry point, which invokes the SpringApplication#run method to bootstrap the application.
### :leaves: <span style="color: aqua">What is Spring Initializer?</span>
Spring Initializer is a web application that helps you to create an initial spring boot project structure and provides a maven or gradle file to build your code. It solves the problem of setting up a framework when you are starting a project from scratch
### :leaves: <span style="color: aqua">Is it possible to change the port of the embedded Tomcat server in Spring Boot?</span>
Yes, it is possible. By using the server.port in the application.properties.
### :leaves: <span style="color: aqua">What is the default port of tomcat in spring boot?</span>
The default port of the tomcat server-id 8080. It can be changed by adding sever.port properties in the application.property file.
### :leaves: <span style="color: aqua">Can we override or replace the Embedded tomcat server in Spring Boot?</span>
Yes, we can replace the Embedded Tomcat server with any server by using the Starter dependency in the pom.xml file. Like you can use spring-boot-starter-jetty as a dependency for using a jetty server in your project.
### :leaves: <span style="color: aqua">Can we disable the default web server in the Spring boot application?</span>
Yes, we can use application.properties to configure the web application type i.e spring.main.web-application-type=none
### :leaves: <span style="color: aqua">Explain @RestController annotation in Sprint boot?</span>
It is a combination of @Controller and @ResponseBody, used for creating a restful controller. It converts the response to JSON or XML. It ensures that data returned by each method will be written straight into the response body instead of returning a template.

### :leaves: <span style="color: aqua">What is the difference between @RestController and @Controller in Spring Boot?</span>
@Controller Map of the model object to view or template and make it human readable but @RestController simply returns the object and object data is directly written in HTTP response as JSON or XML
### :leaves: <span style="color: aqua">What is the difference between RequestMapping and GetMapping?</span>
RequestMapping can be used with GET, POST, PUT, and many other request methods using the method attribute on the annotation. Whereas getMapping is only an extension of RequestMapping which helps you to improve on clarity on request
### :leaves: <span style="color: aqua">What is an IOC container?</span>
IoC Container is a framework for implementing automatic dependency injection. It manages object creation and its life-time and also injects dependencies into the class.
